description: Use Anime UI components to animate your pages.

**Anime UI is a distribution of React components** built with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Motion](https://motion.dev/), based on the shadcn registry and inspired by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and [Magic UI](https://magicui.design/). Our goal is to help anyone add tasteful, accessible, Motion‑powered animation to their UI while keeping sites fast and maintainable.
